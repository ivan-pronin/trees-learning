# Tree Algorithms Practice

This repository is dedicated to **learning and practicing tree data structures in depth**.  
It contains **implementations in Java** for a variety of classic tree problems, together with **unit tests**.

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand **tree fundamentals** and **traversal techniques**.
- Master **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: insertion, deletion, balancing basics.
- Learn **Heap / Priority Queue internals** via heapify operations.
- Solve **common tree interview problems** (~30 tasks total).
- Build a strong foundation for **systematic problem solving with trees**.

## ðŸ“š Topics & Task List

### 1. Tree Traversals (Basics)
- [âœ…] Pre-order traversal (recursive & iterative).
- [âœ…] In-order traversal (recursive & iterative).
- [âœ…] Post-order traversal (recursive & iterative).
- [âœ…] Level-order (BFS) traversal.
- [âœ…] Zig-zag / Spiral level-order traversal.
- [âœ…] Serialize & Deserialize binary tree.

### 2. Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations
- [ ] Insert into a BST.
- [ ] Search in a BST.
- [ ] Delete a node from a BST.
- [âœ…] Validate BST.
- [âœ…] Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in a BST.
- [âœ…] Kth smallest / largest element in a BST.
- [âœ…] Convert sorted array to BST.

### 3. Heaps / Priority Queue
- [ ] Implement Min-Heap (heapify up/down).
- [ ] Implement Max-Heap.
- [ ] Heap sort.
- [ ] Convert array to heap (buildHeap).
- [ ] Kth largest element in array using heap.
- [ ] Merge K sorted lists (using heap).

### 4. General Binary Tree Problems
- [ ] Maximum depth of binary tree.
- [ ] Diameter of binary tree.
- [ ] Balanced binary tree check.
- [ ] Path sum problems (hasPathSum, all path sums).
- [ ] Invert / Mirror a binary tree.
- [ ] Subtree check (isSubtree).
- [ ] Count good nodes in binary tree.
- [ ] Find all nodes at distance K.
- [ ] Delete nodes and return forest.
- [ ] Construct binary tree from preorder & inorder traversal.

## ðŸ§ª Testing
Each task will include:
- **Implementation in Java.**
- **Unit tests (JUnit 5).**
- Example-driven verification.

---

## ðŸš€ Goal
By completing these 30 tasks, the repository will serve as a **solid reference for tree algorithms** and a **personal learning archive**.  
It should cover **most common interview-style questions** and give practical confidence in working with trees.
